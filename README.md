# Another Alternatives

Inspired by [Alternatives](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Alternatives/).

This project follows similar concept but aims to be smaller, lighter, and more helpful.

- Simple commands and switches, instead of heavy graphical interfaces like `OneConfig` (I know it is convenient, but not for this project)
- Lightweight, modular mods, instead of an all-in-one mod
- No auto-added dependencies like `Essential` (all I want is just what I download)
- Includes additional tweaks and tools to enhance experience,  beyond just being an alternative

No SkyBlock mods since I don't play.

### If you don't know

##### **Resource Packs** and **Shader Packs** may be more powerful than you think!

  - **Resource packs** not only modify item textures, but also modify item models. Mods like **Item Size** can be implemented without relying on the Forge Mods, just by using the original resource packs.
  - **Shader Packs** control the shaders for the entire game. This means that mods like **Full Brightness**, **Color Saturation**, etc., can be completely handled by them. (Although it may lower the FPS, it can still serve as a viable alternative)
  
Some of the mods listed in this project are labeled as:
```
Resource pack | Shader pack
```
This means that the same functionality can be archived with either, expanding your options!
