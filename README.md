# Another Alternatives

Inspired by [Alternatives](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Alternatives/).

This project follows similar concept but aims to be smaller, lighter, and more helpful.

- Simple commands and switches, instead of heavy graphical interfaces like `OneConfig` (I know most people like it, but it is not my style)
- Lightweight, modular mods, instead of an all-in-one mod
- No auto-added dependencies like `Essential` (all I want is just what I download)
- Includes additional tweaks and tools to enhance experience,  beyond just being an alternative

No SkyBlock mods since I don't play.
