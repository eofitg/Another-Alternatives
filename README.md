# `Lite-Alternatives`

Inspired by [Alternatives](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Alternatives/).

Lite-Alternatives follows the same concept but aims to be smaller, lighter, and more helpful.

- Simple commands and switches, instead of heavy graphical interfaces like `OneConfig` (useful, but not my style)
- Lightweight, modular mods, instead of an all-in-one mod
- No auto-added dependencies like `Essential` (all I want is just what I download)
- Includes additional tweaks and tools to enhance experience,  beyond just being an alternative
